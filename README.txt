dark net — Frontend-only Demo (Static)

This is a static demo UI built for GitHub Pages. It includes:
- Registration & Login (stored in localStorage)
- Dashboard (Name, UID, Balance, Total Referrals, Status, Telegram link)
- Activate Account (submit TxID once; creates a pending activation request)
- Referral (copy link, list referred users; referrer gets 200৳ when admin approves)
- Earning (Coming soon text)
- Withdraw (min 300৳, creates pending request and deducts immediately)
- Profile Settings (change name/password, theme toggle, logout)
- Admin Panel (view members, approve/reject activation, complete/reject withdrawals)
  NOTE: Click "Become Admin (Demo)" to grant yourself admin in this demo.

⚠️ This is FRONTEND ONLY. No real payments. All data is saved in the browser (localStorage).
Deploy by uploading these files to your GitHub Pages repository root.
